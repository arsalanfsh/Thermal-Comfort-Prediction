Energy consumption in buildings is due to lights, appliances and  air-conditioning. Besides attaining a healthy indoor environment, a prior knowledge about the occupantâ€™s thermal comfort can be beneficial in reducing energy consumption, as it can save energy which is otherwise spent in extra cooling or heating purpose.This project is a data-driven approach to predict individual thermal comfort using environmental and human factors as input.
